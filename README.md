In this Notebook, I have done Feature Scaling using sklearn (Standardization)
In this process where if you apply Standardisation on any Feature, then After applying Standardization
New Feature mean must be 0 and std must be equal to 1. 
Z  = (Xi - Mean) // STD

The other Notebook Contain, How we can impute missing values, if missing values present in any Feature 
of the dataset.
I have used Data Visualization such as "Matrix and Bar Plot" to see the missing in our Features.

I have added another notebook and a Binarization file that contain two python file app.py and Result.py
these file have code how to Binarization, Mean Removal and MinMaxScalar using OPPS Concept.
and finally, the notebook Sklean.ipynb contain same code of Binarization, Mean Removal and MinMaxScalar
