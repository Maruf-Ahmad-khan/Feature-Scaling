In this Notebook, I have done Feature Scaling using sklearn (Standardization)
In this process where if you apply Standardisation on any Feature, then After applying Standardization
New Feature mean must be 0 and std must be equal to 1. 
Z  = (Xi - Mean) // STD

The other Notebook Contain, How we can impute missing values, if missing values present in any Feature 
of the dataset.
I have used Data Visualization such as "Matrix and Bar Plot" to see the missing in our Features.
